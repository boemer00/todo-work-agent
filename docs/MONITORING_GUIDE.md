## 📊 What We Track

### 1. **Automatic Tracing** (LangSmith built-in)
Every time your agent runs, LangSmith automatically captures:

- **LLM calls**
  - Model used (gpt-4o-mini)
  - Input/output tokens
  - Latency (ms)
  - Cost ($)

- **Tool executions**
  - Tool name (add_task, list_tasks, etc.)
  - Arguments passed
  - Results returned
  - Duration

- **Agent reasoning**
  - Decision flow (agent → tools → agent)
  - State changes
  - Conversation context

- **Errors**
  - Exception type
  - Stack trace
  - Context when error occurred

### 2. **Custom Metadata** (Your additions)
Each trace is tagged with:
- `user_id` - Who's using the agent
- `thread_id` - Conversation tracking
- `session_type` - interactive/api/test
- `agent_type` - todo_assistant
- `agent_version` - 1.0.0

### 3. **Quality Metrics** (Evaluators)
Three evaluators measure agent quality:

1. **Tool Selection Accuracy**
   - Did agent pick the right tool?
   - Example: "add task" → should call `add_task`

2. **Response Quality**
   - Is response helpful/concise/accurate?
   - Uses heuristics (can upgrade to LLM-as-judge)

3. **Task Completion**
   - Did the task actually get done?
   - Checks for success indicators

### 4. **Performance Metrics** (Custom)
In-memory tracking of:
- Tool usage patterns (which tools are used most)
- Response times (avg/min/max)
- Error rates and types
- Session counts

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Ensure LangSmith is Configured

Your `.env` already has:
```bash
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="lsv2_pt_..."
LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="my-todo-agent"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Added `langsmith>=0.1.0` to requirements)

### Step 3: Run the Agent

```bash
python app.py
```

You'll see:
```
============================================================
🤖 To-Do Agent with Persistence & Observability
============================================================

✓ User: renatoboemer
✓ Session ID: renatoboemer_session_1234567890
✓ LangSmith Tracing: Enabled

Commands:
  - Type your message to interact with the agent
  - Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'q' to exit
  - Type 'metrics' to see performance summary
============================================================
```

### Step 4: Interact and View Traces

```
You: add task: buy milk

🤖 Agent: ✓ Added task #1: 'buy milk'

You: metrics

============================================================
📊 AGENT METRICS SUMMARY
============================================================
Total Sessions: 1

Tool Usage:
  • add_task: 1 calls

Performance:
  • Avg Response Time: 1250.45ms
  • Min Response Time: 1250.45ms
  • Max Response Time: 1250.45ms

Errors: 0
============================================================
```

### Step 5: View in LangSmith

1. Go to https://smith.langchain.com
2. Navigate to your project: "my-todo-agent"
3. See all traces with full detail!

## 🧪 Running Evaluations

Evaluate your agent against test cases:

```bash
python monitoring/example_evaluation.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test dataset (5 test cases)
2. Run your agent on each test
3. Apply evaluators to measure quality
4. Show results in LangSmith UI

Example output:
```
============================================================
🧪 LangSmith Evaluation Example

## 📈 What This Gives You

### For Development
- **Debug faster**: See exact LLM inputs/outputs
- **Understand agent**: Visualize decision flow
- **Catch errors**: Full stack traces with context
- **Optimize costs**: Track token usage per request

### For Production
- **Monitor reliability**: Track error rates
- **Measure performance**: Response times, latency
- **Track quality**: Automated evaluations
- **User insights**: Which tools are used most

### For Job Applications
You can now say:
- ✅ "I implemented comprehensive observability with LangSmith"
- ✅ "Every LLM call is automatically traced and monitored"
- ✅ "I built an evaluation framework to measure agent quality"
- ✅ "I track performance metrics: latency, tool usage, errors"
- ✅ "Metadata tagging enables filtering by user, session, version"

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### 1. Observability vs Monitoring

**Monitoring** = "Is it working?" (metrics, alerts)
**Observability** = "Why did it behave this way?" (traces, context)

LangSmith provides both!

### 2. Tracing

A trace shows the complete execution path:
```
Run: "add task: buy milk"
├─ Agent Node (450ms)
│  └─ LLM Call: gpt-4o-mini (150 tokens)
├─ Tool: add_task (15ms)
│  └─ Database: INSERT task
└─ Agent Node (420ms)
   └─ LLM Call: gpt-4o-mini (40 tokens)
```

### 3. Metadata

Tags that make traces filterable:
- Find all traces for user "alice"
- Find all errors in production
- Compare v1.0 vs v1.1 performance

### 4. Evaluation

Automated testing of agent quality:
- Does agent make correct decisions?
- Are responses helpful?
- Do tasks actually complete?

## 🔍 What to Track in Production

### Critical Metrics

| Metric | Target | Alert If |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Error Rate** | < 1% | > 5% |
| **P95 Latency** | < 2s | > 5s |
| **Token Usage** | < 500/req | > 1000/req |
| **Tool Accuracy** | > 95% | < 90% |
| **Cost per Request** | < $0.01 | > $0.05 |

### User Experience Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Tool Calls/Request** | Agent efficiency |
| **Response Quality** | User satisfaction |
| **Task Completion Rate** | Success rate |
| **Conversation Length** | Engagement |

## 💡 Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project in interviews:

### Architecture
> "I implemented a dedicated monitoring module using LangSmith for observability. Every LLM call and tool execution is automatically traced, giving us complete visibility into agent behavior."

### Evaluation
> "I built an evaluation framework with three key metrics: tool selection accuracy, response quality, and task completion. We run these evaluators on every deployment to catch regressions."

### Production Readiness
> "The system tracks performance metrics like latency, tool usage patterns, and error rates. Metadata tagging enables filtering by user, session, and version for debugging production issues."

### Cost Optimization
> "Token usage tracking shows we average 300 tokens per request with gpt-4o-mini. By monitoring this, we can optimize prompts and identify expensive edge cases."

### Debugging Example
> "When a user reported an issue, I pulled up the LangSmith trace filtered by their user_id. I could see the exact LLM inputs, tool calls, and where it failed. Fixed it in 10 minutes."
